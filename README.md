# MuZero algorithm for Tower of Hanoi
## Introduction
Implementation of the famous [MuZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265) algorithm  to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. This algorithm aims to provide a baseline algorithm to compare it to human planning performance on the same problem. To do so, I simplfied the MuZero algorithm to its core components, taking away some of the additional elements needed to solve more compex task.  
Next, we ablate different MuZero components in the attempt to understand planning deficits across different neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's and cerebellar lesions.
